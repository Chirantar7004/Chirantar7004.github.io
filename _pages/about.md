Welcome,

My name is Chirantar Nalawade and I am security researcher currently studying Masters in Informatics in final semester at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/research). I am also currently working with Research and Development team at PwC Cyber Security since October 2018. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a very good performance from the University of Mumbai in 2016. 

I look forward to solving critical problems in the security domain. Solving problems with code has been one of my key strengths & since last 8 year, I have been dealing with several programming languages such as C, Java, and Python and with my innate ability to learn a new technology faster
 
Having specialist knowledge in IT security gained through masters degree [coursework](https://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/masters-programs/informatics/elective-modules/fpo-2007-and-fpsos-since-2012/) at TUM and working with PwC as research and development in cyber security enables to tackle any challenges in IT security with ease.

Currently, I am researching on the intersection of machine learning technique of Natural Language Processing with security issues such as privacy and classification under [Prof. Jens Grossklags](https://www.in.tum.de/cybertrust/home/) at TUM.
 
My bachelor thesis was focused on efficient discovery of XSS and SQL Injection vulnerability. Through innovative technique of combining 2 well known pentesting methods i.e. black box testing and white box testing, I was able to increase the efficiency of the detection of both vulnerabilities.

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and play table-tennis.
