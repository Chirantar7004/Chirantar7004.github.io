Hi, I'm Chirantar Nalawade and I am a Computer Scientist currently working at in CISO team of [Max Planck Institute of Computing and Data Facility/MPCDF](https://www.mpcdf.mpg.de). I completed my Masters in Informatics at the elite [Technical University of Munich](https://www.in.tum.de/en/research) with meritious performance! Prior to joining MPCDF, I was working with Research and Development team at PwC Cyber Security for 2 years. I have also done Graduate Research internship at [Institute of Ethics in AI](https://ieai.mcts.tum.de/) with intersection of AI, Ethics and current EU compliance rules under the Director [Prof. Dr. Christoph LÃ¼tge](https://ieai.mcts.tum.de/about-ieai/people/prof-christoph-luetge/). For more detail insights, you can download my CV [here](https://ieai.mcts.tum.de/about-ieai/people/prof-christoph-luetge/).

I look forward to solving critical problems in the security domain. Solving problems with code has been one of my key strengths & since last 8 year, I have been dealing with several programming languages such as C, Java, and Python and with my innate ability to learn a new technology faster
 
I have also gained specialist knowledge in IT security ranging from various topics such as Cloud Security, Application Security to Confidential and Secure AI  via [extensive coursework](https://www.in.tum.de/en/current-students/masters-programs/informatics/elective-modules/fpo-2007-and-fpsos-since-2012/) at TUM.


My master thesis was on the intersection of machine learning techniques of Natural Language Processing and differential privacy to provide a confidential Deep Learning on Natural Language Processing under [Prof. Jens Grossklags](https://www.in.tum.de/cybertrust/home/) at TUM.
 
My bachelor thesis was focused on efficient discovery of XSS and SQL Injection vulnerability. Through innovative technique of combining 2 well known pentesting methods i.e. black box testing and white box testing, I was able to increase the efficiency of the detection of both vulnerabilities.

In my free time, I enjoy playing piano and chess.
