After leaving IIT Madras Metallurgy and ICT chemical engg only for cs which attracted a lot of condemning along with innumerable obstacles that came through this whole journey, this day was really most special moments of my life. Dream that had been started right from 5 years down the line finally met with its destiny(never expected a world wide 9th rank university afterall). I personally never imagined that I would be able to get in prestigious TUM. Here is how it started!

**Researching appropriate universities**
While almost all of my friends made use of consultancy to ease up pressure of handling necessary admission documents and helping hands to write a great cover letter, I didn't join them and instead choose to do it my own way. I did lot of research before penning down universities to apply and TUM was itself quite ambitious for my profile. 

**Waiting Game!**
I was anxiously waiting after sending the documents which had not been received at Munich and had been untracable! I had thought that admission procedure would have been over as I saw many getting rejects on [gradcafe](https://www.thegradcafe.com/survey/index.php?q=Computer+Science). 

**Results**
While I was working for Tata Consultancy services on that day, I had done most of the required tasks of the day and was waiting near the canteen during lunch time. As I received the notification, it showed up the preview of mail from TUM without the content!(old phone) Alas, I got frightened to read it as it could have been a rejection. But wait, it was an accept! ![Admission!](/images/TUM_admission.jpg) 

I couldn't believe it and made my friends to read it for me, hahaha! Thanks a ton to all my family and friends who stayed with me in toughest times :') ...I have no words others than "Hell yeah TUM " :')
